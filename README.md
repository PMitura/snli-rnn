# SNLI Recurrent Neural Network

A Tensorflow based RNN for predicting sentence relationships in [The Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Corpus](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/).

# Installation

Please ensure that all requirements from `requirements.txt` are satisfied. The full dataset download, preprocessing and training can be launched using:

```
python3 run.py
```

Arguments `download`, `preprocess` and `train` can be used for running separate modules of the process (the app saves intermediate results of modules).

Work submitted for MI-MVI.16 course at FIT CTU. Future tweaking is likely, this README will be rewritten with more detailed description afterwards.
